\section{Materialized views}
In this section we will propose some materialized views that aim to improve the execution time of the chosen queries.
\subsection{Lineitem-part}
In order to improve performances in executing query 14 we decided to create a materialized view as follow:
\begin{sql}
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW part_lineitem AS
SELECT
    l_returnflag,
    l_linestatus,
    l_quantity,
    l_extendedprice,
    l_discount,
    l_tax,
    l_shipdate,
    l_partkey,
    p_partkey,
    p_brand,
    p_container,
    SUBSTRING(p_type FROM 1 FOR 5) AS p_type_prefix,
    0.2 * AVG(l_quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY l_partkey) AS avg_quantity
FROM
    lineitem l
JOIN
    part p ON l.l_partkey = p.p_partkey;
\end{sql}
Materializing the join operation of query 14 we expect to have a lower execution time with respect to the baseline.

\textbf{Statistics of this view:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Required time to create the view: 299.809 seconds
    \item Size of the view: 6.43 GB.
